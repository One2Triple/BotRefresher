Hi there! I've been trying to get into programming, and I first looked at a simple tool to let my bots run without me being worried of programs stopping because of network issues when I'm not home, or while sleeping. I made a simple batch program to go with any bot (at least that is the idea). I made it based on ezBot by @Hesa, so it should work with that one without problem, just open the batch and modify the SET parameters depending on how you have them set.
