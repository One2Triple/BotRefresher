Hi there! I've been trying to get into programming, and I first looked at a simple tool to let my bots run without me being worried of programs stopping because of network issues when I'm not home, or while sleeping. I made a simple batch program to go with any bot (at least that is the idea). 
This is still Alpha, so test with that in mind :)
